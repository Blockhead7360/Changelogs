    <h1>DMSLauncher Changelog - current version 1.10.2</h1>
    <p><br><br><br></p>
    
    <p><b>1.10.3 (January 23, 2020)</b>
      <br>
      <br><u>Major changes</u>
      <br>- Download options and keybinds presets! For new players, rather than having to sit down and have Dilan help you set up your options and keybinds (lots of stuff because of all the mod keybinds), you can just download a preset (made by Dilan or someone else) before you launch your game.
      <br>
      <br><u>Minor changes</u>
      <br>- Some bug fixes.
    </p>

      <br><u>Major changes</u>
      <br>- A bunch of UI changes! New view for logging in and DMSLauncher update available, and Accounts view has been updated.
      <br>- Updated installation process (it's better now trust me).
      <br>
      <br><u>Minor changes</u>
      <br>- Removed auto launch, launch offline, random hello messages, update without launch, and standalone settings menu (settings are now in Accounts view).
      <br>- Better error management (removed mail).
      <br>- Temporarily removed the delete game files button (I'll probably add that back later).
      <br>- Installation summary always shows when a modded client update is available.
      <br>- You now can't use the DMSLauncher unless it's on the latest version.

      <br>
      <br><u>Major changes</u>
      <br>- Accounts! A new tab where you can view your payment status and other account information.
      <br>- Auto Launch! You can now have the Minecraft launcher open without having to press "Play Minecraft". Enable this in the settings.

      <br>- More detailed error reports and the app now closes after an error is thrown.
      <br>- Developer mode (for me).
      <br>- Open game folder from the settings.
      <br>- Changed DMSLauncher program files to be less messy in your Documents.
      <br>- You can now change the RAM allocation when installing the game before running it (instead of having it install and automatically open the Minecraft launcher, where you then have to close out, reopen the DMSLauncher, and change the RAM).
      <br>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>1.9.2 (July 12, 2019)</b>
      <br>
      <br><u>Minor changes</u>
      <br>- Fixed a server rules issue.
      <br>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>1.9.1 (July 12, 2019)</b>
      <br>
      <br><u>Major changes</u>
      <br>- Server rules now shown in the DMSLauncher! View a list of the server rules from inside the launcher and view more information about each of them.
      <br>
      <br><u>Minor changes</u>
      <br>- Changed RAM Allocation message.
      <br>- Added a What's New button.
      <br>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>1.9.0 (June 10, 2019)</b>
      <br>
      <br><u>Major changes</u>
      <br>- Server status! View the status of the Minecraft server inside the launcher (online/offline, player count, player list).
      <br>- Completely removed the Chat and Manage Server tabs (don't need them right now) - replaced chat settings with support options.
      <br>- Changed theme for the Windows version of the application.
      <br>- RAM Allocation options now include 6400 MB - 11520 MB.
      <br>- Removed the glitchy application auto updater. It didn't work well with the newer versions of the program. It will still check for program updates and inform you, but instead of automatically installing the newer version, it will only download the new version and you must replace it yourself.
      <br>
      <br><u>Minor changes</u>
      <br>- Added a 'server no longer exists' message (displayed if the server you're currently logged into in the app was removed).
      <br>- Added an 'unable to load image' message if there's a problem loading the title image.
      <br>- Delete game files for other folders (pre pre pre alpha release I don't think this even works).
      <br>- Fixed remote disable of installation and play.
      <br>- Changed the console's font size and format.
      <br>- Replaced instances of blockhead7360.com with dilanmail.com (new transfer)
      <br>- Catches more errors than it did before.
      <br>- Removed server version from application version number.
      <br>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>1.8.4.5 (August 10, 2018)</b>
      <br>
      <br><u>Major changes</u>
      <br>- You can now delete your game files to reinstall fresh in the Settings tab.
      <br>- If you don't have enough internet connection to check for updates, you can now Launch Offline, which will launch the game without checking for updates.
      <br>
      <br><u>Minor changes</u>
      <br>- Fixed the Windows initial load issue.
      <br>- Fixed a few bugs
      <br>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>1.8.3.5 (June 10, 2018)</b>
      <br>
      <br><u>Minor changes</u>
      <br>- Fixed from producing a .command file permissions error on macOS.
      <br>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>1.8.2.5 (June 10, 2018)</b>
      <br>
      <br><u>Minor changes</u>
      <br>- Added installation of pre-generated configuration files, scripts, and other extra files.
      <br>- Now ignores files that don't end with .jar in the mods folder (was causing issues before).
      <br>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>1.8.1.5 (June 10, 2018)</b>
      <br>
      <br><u>Major changes</u>
      <br>- Fixed 1 defective feature. 1) A simple, stupid error on my part for the Windows version when launching Minecraft was fixed.
      <br>
      <br><u>Minor changes</u>
      <br>- Added progress count to the status label when the application is deleting or downloading mods.
      <br>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>1.8.0.5 (June 10, 2018)</b>
      <br>
      <br><u>Major changes</u>
      <br>- Completely new installation system (faster)! Allows for a more fresh install. The DMSLauncher installs Minecraft Forge, mods, etc. and allows the Minecraft launcher to install a fresh copy of the Minecraft game itself, rather than having an old version downloaded in a huge file.
      <br>- Servers in multiple server selection require a password! Each server selection now requires a password (one-time) in the DMSLauncher.
      <br>- Update the mod selection without launching the game! In Settings, there is now an option to check for updates and update the mod selection without launching the game.
      <br>
      <br><u>Minor changes</u>
      <br>- Fixed text of remote feature disable messages.
      <br>- A confirmation dialog appears when trying to exit whilst an operation is in progress.
      <br>- The current Minecraft version, Forge version, and DMSLauncher version are shown in the Settings tab.
      <br>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>1.7.1.5 (June 8, 2018)</b>
      <br>
      <br><u>Major changes</u>
      <br>- Change game directory! If you choose/need to run the client on your own installation of Forge (in a directory other than the one created by the DMSLauncher), you can change the directory that the application will run Minecraft and update the mod selection out of. You can change the game directory in the Settings tab.
      <br>- Fixed 1 logical error. 1) The update checker for mod selection change now checks for the exact file matches rather than the same amount of files.
      <br>- Fixed 1 defective feature. 1) The macOS application updater now works.
      <br>
      <br><u>Minor changes</u>
      <br>- Fixed text in console logging when mods are being downloaded.
      <br>- The current game directory is shown in the Settings tab.
      <br>- The status label (text left of the Play Minecraft button) now has text when the game is starting.
      <br>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>1.7.0.5 (June 5, 2018)</b>
      <br>
      <br><u>Major changes</u>
      <br>- Recoded the whole application to run smoothly and allow for better updates.
      <br>- The Chat and Manage Server tabs have been temporarily removed (probably temporary).
      <br>- Multiple server connections! You can now load multiple mod packs/multiple servers through the application.
      <br>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>1.6.1.4 (October 2017)</b>
      <br>
      <br><u>Minor changes</u>
      <br>- Updated an API.
      <br>- FTP login no longer requires a full application update.
      <br>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>1.6.0.4 (2017)</b>
      <br>
      <br><u>Major changes</u>
      <br>- Added chat feature using FTP server. To login, you must receive your login ID from the administrator (a.k.a. Dilan).
      <br>- Changed the UI look almost completely - it now has tabs instead of all the buttons on one pane.
      <br>- Certain program features can now be disabled remotely for best user experience.
      <br>
      <br><u>Minor changes</u>
      <br>- Saving operations take place on program exit to improve chat handling speed. If the program is unresponsive and requires a force quit (not specifically because of this addition), some chat history may be lost.
      <br>- Prevents the Play Minecraft button from being pressed again after already starting.
      <br>- Included with the chat feature are some settings (including a new file type called .chathist to save and restore chat history).
      <br>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>1.5.1.3 (2017)</b>
      <br>
      <br><u>Major changes</u>
      <br>- Mac .app application file is bundled. Instead of the Mac .app for DMSLauncher launching a jar file, it is now all bundled within so the little white dot appears below the DMSLauncher icon.
      <br>
      <br><u>Minor changes</u>
      <br>- Changed Manage Server passcode encryption and decryption.
      <br>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>1.5.0.3 (2017)</b>
      <br>
      <br><u>Major changes</u>
      <br>- Changed app run method! Instead of running the program with the .jar file, you can use the Mac .app application file and the Windows .exe executable file to run the program. If there is a problem with one of these, you can use the universal jar to run the program.
      <br>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>1.4.0.3 (2017)</b>
      <br>
      <br><u>Major changes</u>
      <br>- The DMSUpdater is now the DMSLauncher! You will use the program not only to update but also to run the game.
      <br>
      <br><u>Changes from DMSUpdater to DMSLauncher</u>
      <br>- Runs the Minecraft launcher when the Play button is pressed.
      <br>- Uses FTP access instead of blockhead7360.com access.
      <br>- Every time the Play button is pressed, a check for updates occurs. You will be able to update and start the game with the click of a button.
      <br>- Admin FTP mods editor from in the program.
      <br>- RAM dedication selection for Minecraft.
      <br>- A few more things that I'm not in the mood to type out.
      <br>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>1.3.1.3 (2017)</b>
      <br>
      <br><u>Minor changes</u>
      <br>- Added a delay when deleting files in case it tries to delete files too fast and mess things up.
      <br>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>1.3.0.3 (2017)</b>
      <br>
      <br><u>Major changes</u>
      <br>- Now supports installing files client side to locations other than the mod folder! Time to install that InGameInfo.xml file lol.
      <br>- A summary can be viewed of everything that the program will delete and install before updating.
      <br>
      <br><u>Minor changes</u>
      <br>- Program version is no longer displayed in the console. It now has its own little label above the console.
      <br>- When a program update is installed, the new update will no longer delete all the other files that contain the text "DMSUpdater" and ".jar." It will now only delete the previous version's file.
      <br>- The title image has been changed for DMS III - FTB Beyond.
      <br>- Version number format has been modified to "x.x.x.y" to show the program version (x) and the DMS game play server version (y).
      <br>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>1.2 (2017)</b>
      <br>
      <br><u>Major changes</u>
      <br>- Okay so connecting to mediafire.com to download the files was also a terrible idea and does not work at all (it's why it gave you the tinker's construct error if you played on DMS II 2.0). Now, all files are downloaded from http://blockhead7360.com/dlservfile. Works perfectly!
      <br>- Added the Auto Updater feature! You will no longer have to come back to this website to download a new version of the DMSUpdater. When you start up the program, if a new version is available, a prompt will appear with the changelog (same as shown here) and a button to update. The update will be installed to the same path (same folder on your computer) as your current version of the program. The old version will delete automatically and the new version will automatically launch after the update is complete.
      <br>
      <br><u>Minor changes</u>
      <br>- More information is shown in the console when downloading files.
      <br>- Program version number is now displayed in the console.
      <br>- When Reset Program Workspace is pressed, the program does not restart in a weird way, it just shuts down. This way, you will have to reopen it, but there won't be any problems.
      <br>- On the startup of the program, a loading prompt will appear so you can confirm that it is loading during the time it takes for the program to startup.
      <br>- Fixed errors that are thrown when no internet connection is found.
      <br>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>1.1 (2017)</b>
      <br>
      <br>- Connecting to http://blockhead7360.com to read script was a terrible idea. How about http://pastebin.com? Ahh... it works.
      <br>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>1.0 (2017)</b>
      <br>
      <br>- All base features were added.
      <br>
