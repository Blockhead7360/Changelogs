# DMSLauncher Changelog


## 1.10.3
January 23 2021

### Major changes
- **Download options and keybinds presets!** For new players, rather than having to sit down and have Dilan help you set up your options and keybinds (lots of stuff because of all the mod keybinds), you can just download a preset (made by Dilan or someone else) before you launch your game.

### Minor changes
- Some bug fixes

### Known issues
- Okay so in the last update I said I fixed the server status display but apparently that was a fat lie.



## 1.10.2
