# DMSLauncher Changelog

## 1.11.0
March 11 2021

### Major changes
- **A new look! And DARK MODE!** I decided to switch the DMSLauncher over to [a new look and feel I found on the internet](https://www.formdev.com/flatlaf/). Now, it looks a bit different (but is consistent across macOS and Windows) and you can switch between light and dark mode.
- **Servers don't have to have accounts!** Now, for servers where requiring each player to have their own DMSLauncher ID is a bit unnecessary, server admins can disable the account requirement and players can access that server on the launcher without an ID.

### Minor changes
- I think I actually fixed the server status display this time.
- Continued transition from using DilanScript 1 to [DilanScript 2](http://docs.blockhead7360.com/dilanscript).
- Small UI and text changes.

### Known issues
- The window title bar (on both macOS and Windows) doesn't change to match dark mode. I tried to find a good solution and couldn't so whatever.

## 1.10.3
January 23 2021

### Major changes
- **Download options and keybinds presets!** For new players, rather than having to sit down and have Dilan help you set up your options and keybinds (lots of stuff because of all the mod keybinds), you can just download a preset (made by Dilan or someone else) before you launch your game.

### Minor changes
- Some bug fixes

### Known issues
- Okay so in the last update I said I fixed the server status display but apparently that was a fat lie.

## 1.9.2
July 12 2019

### Minor changes
- Fixed a server rules issue.


## 1.9.1

- Changed theme for the Windows version of the application.
- RAM Allocation options now include 6400 MB - 11520 MB.

### Minor changes
- Added progress count to the status label when the application is deleting or downloading mods.


## 1.8.0.5
June 10 2018

### Major changes
- Completely new installation system (faster)! Allows for a more fresh install. The DMSLauncher installs Minecraft Forge, mods, etc. and allows the Minecraft launcher to install a fresh copy of the Minecraft game itself, rather than having an old version downloaded in a huge file.
- Servers in multiple server selection require a password! Each server selection now requires a password (one-time) in the DMSLauncher.
- Update the mod selection without launching the game! In Settings, there is now an option to check for updates and update the mod selection without launching the game.

- Fixed text of remote feature disable messages.
- A confirmation dialog appears when trying to exit whilst an operation is in progress.
- The current Minecraft version, Forge version, and DMSLauncher version are shown in the Settings tab.


## 1.7.1.5
June 8 2018

### Major changes
- Change game directory! If you choose/need to run the client on your own installation of Forge (in a directory other than the one created by the DMSLauncher), you can change the directory that the application will run Minecraft and update the mod selection out of. You can change the game directory in the Settings tab.
- Fixed 1 logical error. 1) The update checker for mod selection change now checks for the exact file matches rather than the same amount of files.
- Fixed 1 defective feature. 1) The macOS application updater now works.

### Minor changes
- Fixed text in console logging when mods are being downloaded.
- The current game directory is shown in the Settings tab.
- The status label (text left of the Play Minecraft button) now has text when the game is starting.

## 1.6.1.4
October 2017

### Minor changes
- Updated an API.
- FTP login no longer requires a full application update.


## 1.6.0.4
2017

### Major changes
- Added chat feature using FTP server. To login, you must receive your login ID from the administrator (a.k.a. Dilan).
- Changed the UI look almost completely - it now has tabs instead of all the buttons on one pane.
- Certain program features can now be disabled remotely for best user experience.

### Minor changes
- Saving operations take place on program exit to improve chat handling speed. If the program is unresponsive and requires a force quit (not specifically because of this addition), some chat history may be lost.
- Prevents the Play Minecraft button from being pressed again after already starting.
- Included with the chat feature are some settings (including a new file type called .chathist to save and restore chat history).

## 1.5.1.3
2017

### Major changes
- Mac .app application file is bundled. Instead of the Mac .app for DMSLauncher launching a jar file, it is now all bundled within so the little white dot appears below the DMSLauncher icon.

### Minor changes
- Changed Manage Server passcode encryption and decryption.


## 1.5.0.3
2017

### Major changes
- Changed app run method! Instead of running the program with the .jar file, you can use the Mac .app application file and the Windows .exe executable file to run the program. If there is a problem with one of these, you can use the universal jar to run the program.


## 1.4.0.3
2017

### Major changes
- The DMSUpdater is now the DMSLauncher! You will use the program not only to update but also to run the game.

### Changes from DMSUpdater to DMSLauncher
- Runs the Minecraft launcher when the Play button is pressed.
- Uses FTP access instead of blockhead7360.com access.
- Every time the Play button is pressed, a check for updates occurs. You will be able to update and start the game with the click of a button.
- Admin FTP mods editor from in the program.
- RAM dedication selection for Minecraft.
- A few more things that I'm not in the mood to type out.


## 1.3.1.3
2017

### Minor changes
- Added a delay when deleting files in case it tries to delete files too fast and mess things up.


## 1.3.0.3
2017

### Major changes
- Now supports installing files client side to locations other than the mod folder! Time to install that InGameInfo.xml file lol.
- A summary can be viewed of everything that the program will delete and install before updating.

### Minor changes
- Program version is no longer displayed in the console. It now has its own little label above the console.
- When a program update is installed, the new update will no longer delete all the other files that contain the text "DMSUpdater" and ".jar." It will now only delete the previous version's file.
- The title image has been changed for DMS III - FTB Beyond.
- Version number format has been modified to "x.x.x.y" to show the program version (x) and the DMS game play server version (y).


## 1.2
2017

### Major changes
- Okay so connecting to mediafire.com to download the files was also a terrible idea and does not work at all (it's why it gave you the tinker's construct error if you played on DMS II 2.0). Now, all files are downloaded from http://blockhead7360.com/dlservfile. Works perfectly!
- Added the Auto Updater feature! You will no longer have to come back to this website to download a new version of the DMSUpdater. When you start up the program, if a new version is available, a prompt will appear with the changelog (same as shown here) and a button to update. The update will be installed to the same path (same folder on your computer) as your current version of the program. The old version will delete automatically and the new version will automatically launch after the update is complete.

### Minor changes
- More information is shown in the console when downloading files.
- Program version number is now displayed in the console.
- When Reset Program Workspace is pressed, the program does not restart in a weird way, it just shuts down. This way, you will have to reopen it, but there won't be any problems.
- On the startup of the program, a loading prompt will appear so you can confirm that it is loading during the time it takes for the program to startup.
- Fixed errors that are thrown when no internet connection is found.


## 1.1
2017

- Connecting to http://blockhead7360.com to read script was a terrible idea. How about http://pastebin.com? Ahh... it works.


## 1.0
2017

- All base features were added.
